# Hi! I'm yagel15637, or Reap#9000 on Discord.

### I do all kinds of programming in various programming languages, most common ones being Kotlin (For FTC Programming), and Java (For Minecraft Utility Mod Programming), but I can help with whatever you need help with!

##### If You need any help just mention me in a pull request's comment (@yagel15637), or DM me on Discord, I'm ~~(almost)~~ always ready to help! (NOTE: Please don't waste my time with stupid questions like "how do I skid kami". I will not answer.).
